About git repositary:
-------------------
Git is distributed version control repositary system.

From first video:-
----------------

git init <directory>
git add
git status
git commit -m
git log
git rm --cached <file name>

git log --oneline

after changing any file:
	1. fist we have to add that file to cached area
	2. then we have to commit to local repositary using "git commit" command.

we can do these two steps with a single command is

git commit -a -m "mesg"

when we changed or modified a file, if we want to remove last changes occur in the file use

git checkout -- <filename>

******************* ABOVE ALL COMMANDS ARE ACTUALLY USING TO COMMIT THE FILES INTO LOCAL REPOSITORY *********************
