 About git repositary:
-------------------
Git is distributed version control repositary system.

From first video:-
----------------

git init <directory>
git add
git status
git commit -m
git log
git rm --cached <file name>

git log --oneline

after changing any file:
	1. fist we have to add that file to cached area
	2. then we have to commit to local repositary using "git commit" command.

we can do these two steps with a single command is

git commit -a -m "mesg"

when we changed or modified a file, if we want to remove last changes occur in the file use

git checkout -- <filename>

******************* ABOVE ALL COMMANDS ARE ACTUALLY USING TO COMMIT THE FILES INTO LOCAL REPOSITORY *********************

------------------------>>>>>>>>entering or saving files from local repository to remote repositary
	1.after all the commits made or required commit is over..if you want to save that in remote repositary
		a. first you have to create a account in the github
			--goto "www.github.com" and signup.
			--if you want to see the latest version of git goto "www.git-scm.com".
			-- this account is a PUBLIC . any one can see your files and modify those. because it is free account.
			-- if you want to protect from accessing by others you have to pay money as monthly charges.
			-- here when you create repositary the default branch is "MASTER"
		b. after signin you can find your userid as your account and there you can create your repositarys.
		c. create one repository and say "MyGITsaving"
		d. the remote repositary name can be found with following syntax
			
			"git@github.com:'username'/'repositary name'.git"
	2.now use command to create remote repositary
		git remote add origin git@github.com:Gashoka/MyGITsaving.git
			--here origin is the default name of remote repositary..
				you can use any name here other than origin
	3.Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
		git push origin master
			--origin is the remote repositary name 
			-- master is the default branch of repositary where you want to transfer commits
	4.The git pull Command

		Merging upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration workflows.
		 We already know how to do this with git fetch followed by git merge, but git pull rolls this into a single command.
		
			git pull origin master
	5.The git fetch Command

		The git fetch command imports commits from a remote repository into your local repo. 
		The resulting commits are stored as remote branches instead of the normal local branches that weâ€™ve been working with. 
		This gives you a chance to review changes before integrating them into your copy of the project.
	
			git fetch origin master
	6.the Git clone(exactly the same copy) command
		Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository 
		(visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository's currently active branch.
